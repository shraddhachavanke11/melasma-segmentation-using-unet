The proposed solution for melasma 
detection uses U-net convolutional networks. This 
offers an efficient and scalable method for the early 
detection of melasma, allowing for individualized 
treatment plans. The accuracy of the system is 
90.97%. model is trained using 2000 images of augumented dataset.
